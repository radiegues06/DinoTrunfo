# DinoTrunfo
Game programmed in java to implement the game "Super Trunfo" (Top Trumps).

Ideas about how to play the game: 
  - It will be possible to play showing only one card.
    1. The user has to guess the option for the specific dinossaur.
    2. The user can get a tip by seeing the dinossaur image. Every time the user sees the image, he loses some score.
    3. If the user guesses the characteristic right or at least close (for numbers) he gains score.
  
  - Comparing two cards:
    1. The user will see two random cards and a random field and he has to say which dinossaur will win.
    2. If the user guesses it right, then the user gains score. Otherwise, he loses some score.
